# replit

The main section of the app is focused on the code editor. The code editor is the largest section and
it includes basic syntax highlighting for Python, allowing users to quickly check their syntax.

The results panel is anchored on the bottom of the screen since it is logically the next step in the
flow (i.e., write code, run code, view results). The panel expands and collapses so you can view
larger results sets and also get it out of the way when you are back to writing code.

The run button is anchored to the bottom right-side of the screen, which is easy to reach,
making it easy to iteratively edit code and execute.
